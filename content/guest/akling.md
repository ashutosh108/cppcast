Andreas has been writing open source C++ for the last 15 years, working on projects like KDE, Qt and WebKit. Nowadays he puts all of his free time into SerenityOS, a new Unix-like operating system with the look & feel of a 90s office computer. Everything from kernel to web browser is done in-house in modern C++. He frequently posts videos of his programming sessions to YouTube and wants to share his joy of programming with the world.
