JeanHeyd "ThePhD" is a student at Columbia University in New York and an organizer for [Shepherd's Oasis, LLC](https://soasis.org/). They are the [Project Editor for the C Language](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/contacts), and they manage a large open-source contribution -- sol2 -- that is used across many industries and academic disciplines. They are currently working towards earning their own nickname, climbing the academic ladder while spending as much time as possible contributing to C++ standardization and development. Their newest and biggest project is Unicode for C++. Learn more about JeanHeyd's work [at their website](https://soasis.org), and more about Shepherd's Oasis [through their website](https://soasis.org/about).

They very much love dogs and hopes to have their own in a year or so. They also like TWRP's "Feels Pretty Good" from the album Together Through Time.
